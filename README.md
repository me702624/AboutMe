Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ‘‹ My name's Titichaya Bunnak

I am a Project manager/Scrum Master with the ScrumMasterÂ® certification with 9+ years of experience in the IT industry. And I just recently completed in Frontend Developer Bootcamp and ServiceNow NextGen Professional Program also. I love to solve business problems with my coding & problem-solving skills. Love to see my work can make a good impact on one, achieving/learning something new and provide more gas in your tank and make you more productive. meanwhile, I can develop my skill set to be better for myself and love to teach and pass them to others, so I'm actually great at mentoring other colleagues.

Give more, learn more. Be better each day. Be kind and be inspired. the three sentences that I always keep in mind as mission-driven in my career path.

In my free time, I like to play muaythai, badminton, and basketball.

For inquiries, you can reach out to me on LinkedIn. Thanks.ðŸ™‚



My goal is to improve my skills every day to be able to be more productive.
